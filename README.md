## Preprocessing Pipeline

This repository contains a Python preprocessing pipeline for VSDI data.

Steps implemented:
1. Split raw MATLAB cond files into single-condition arrays
2. Frame-zero normalization (per trial)
3. Blank normalization using condition 3
4. Z-score normalization using baseline frames

Raw and processed data are intentionally excluded from version control.
